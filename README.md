# Visualisation-Final-Project
Academic Project for CSE-546

This Dataset for this project is collected from the Unified Crime Reporting Statistics and under the collaboration of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation information crime 
statistics. Our Dashboard will provide insights on types of crime are prevalent in different states in U.S. It can be used to view co-relation amongst the crimes prevalent in different areas
in U.S. such as East Coast, West Coast, Mid West etc. We can view trends of crime over the years. 
Our dashboard visualises the data with the help of a Line Chart, Bar Graph, Choropleth Map, Parallel Co-ordinates Plot, Pie Chart and Radar Chart.

Crime Data Analysis will provide insights between Location, Time and relation on how one is related to another. It can help in proper law enforcement and assist FBI and U.S. Dept. of Justice 
to derive proper strategy to mitigate these issues. These preventive measures can help in reducing crime rates.
